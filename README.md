# DSA
Welcome to my curated collection of **DSA solutions** and **notes**, built with in C++. Perfect for acing coding interviews, revising key concepts, and mastering problem-solving.

This is an ongoing personal project where I’ve organized a broad range of Data Structures and Algorithm topics—each in its own folder—with handpicked questions, clean implementations, and concise notes.

#this repo reflects my journey through key patterns and problems, including contributions from Striver’s SDE Sheet, LeetCode
